        Who is truly happy? <br>
        And how do know? <br>
        How do you know that you're truly content with your life? <br>
        In the world where the internet is full of immediate ennthusiasm <br>
        Posts of morning routines that add value more to the creator <br>
        by holding THEM accountable <br>

        How do you know that you that you're truly content with your life? <br>
        That you can: <br>
        Instead of broadening your interests you can narrow them and go deeper. <br>
        Go deeper because you're satisfied w/ what you have. <br>
        Go deeper because humans don't remeber and need to revise <br>
        Repetition is the mother of wisdom they said in my native tongue <br>
        I didn't believe <br>
        I was too young <br>
        Who would <br>
    
        The shiny new object is more attractive for a youngster <br>
        Little they know that under the surface <br>
        Under the surface there is that same old message <br>

          Find your values in life <br>
