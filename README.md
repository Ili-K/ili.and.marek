# ili.and.marek
This is our relationship project. Ili is Marek's GF and Marek is Ili's BF. 
<br> We met on a dance class for the first time. And then couple years later in a church. 
<br>It was in that church, that we decided to continue dancing. And then dating. 
<br> And then going on a month-long trip into the mountains. And then living together.

## Here we are documenting our every day lives.
We enjoy working on our relationship. Every month we 
<br> have a relationship retreat where we focus on 
<br> expressing our needs and bettering our relationship 
<br> (and also crying, cause these conversations are hard hard).

<br> We also like adventure. Hinkig, cooking in the nature, 
<br> backcountry skiing, acroyoga.


And also Ili is learning programming so there's that.
