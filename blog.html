        <h2>My biggest dream career is to be stay at home mom</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li> So I would really love to be a stay at home mom, that's kind of a dream "career" of mine. <br>
              I once told my ex about this and his reply was: "Oh, but you wouldn't want to do JUST that, right." <br>
              I did feel ashamed but then my now bf has been really accpeting of that and he actually supports that decision. <br>
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKFypHcnGu4"> This </a> video has been really motivating for me to <br>
              stay true to my "career goal" without feeling like I'm not enough.</li>
            <li> Also in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmzjW-I09ZQ"> this video</a> she talks about how <br>
              "our" dreams are often not really ours. She talks about how it's easier to pick some prefabricated <br>
              dream and to follow it on order to fit in the society. </li>
            <li> In half an hour I have an appointment w/ my hairdresser. <br>
              I'm currently getting back to my curly hair routine. <br>
              If you have curly hair like me and would like to make them loof super healthy, <br>

        Who is truly happy? <br>
        And how do know? <br>
        How do you know that you're truly content with your life? <br>
        In the world where the internet is full of immediate ennthusiasm <br>
        Posts of morning routines that add value more to the creator <br>
        by holding THEM accountable <br>

        How do you know that you that you're truly content with your life? <br>
        That you can: <br>
        Instead of broadening your interests you can narrow them and go deeper. <br>
        Go deeper because you're satisfied w/ what you have. <br>
        Go deeper because humans don't remeber and need to revise <br>
        Repetition is the mother of wisdom they said in my native tongue <br>
        I didn't believe <br>
        I was too young <br>
        Who would <br>
    
        The shiny new object is more attractive for a youngster <br>
        Little they know that under the surface <br>
        Under the surface there is that same old message <br>

          Find your values in life <br>
